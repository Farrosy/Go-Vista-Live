# Changelog

## 2.3.0

### Added
- Added `ReportsService`, accessible via `CloudService.Reports`, for submitting reports against player accounts for policy violations.
- Gathered schema inspector's filter can now search by object name.
- Added GameCenter authentication support.
- Added `CoherenceBridge.onShutdownNotice` and `CoherenceBridge.ScheduledShutdown`, reporting the UTC time at which the Replication Server has been told (through its `POST /shutdown-notice` API endpoint) that it will shut down, together with an optional human readable reason and an optional game-specific custom payload.
- Added `LobbyData.CreatedAt`.
- Added `FriendsService`, accessible via `CloudService.Friends`, for mirroring the friend list a player keeps on their platform (Game Center, PSN, Nintendo, Xbox, Steam, Epic, or a source your own game provides) into coherence Cloud.
- Added support for reserving lobby slots for players.
- Added `LobbyFilter.WithCreatedAt`, for filtering lobby search results by creation time.
- Added `LobbyPlayer.DisplayName` and `LobbyPlayer.AvatarUrl`.
- New APIs for `LobbyService` and `LobbySession` to invite friends to lobbies, via token or join code.
- Added `Tend.TryWriteHeader`, which reports a full reliable window instead of throwing.
- Added friends online presence via `FriendsService`.
- Added `CreateLobbyOptions.HideFromPresence`.

### Changed
- `LobbiesService.FindOrCreateLobbyAsync` now names a lobby it creates after `CreateLobbyOptions.Name`, instead of giving it a generated name.
- `PlayerAccount`'s `Username`, `DisplayName` and `AvatarUrl` are not null but empty strings.

### Fixed
- Fixed the Rooms UI, Worlds UI and Lobbies UI samples not handling UI input in projects that use the Input System package. When they create a missing `EventSystem`, they now add the input module for the active input handling.
- Fixed the Lobbies UI sample shuffling the lobby list. It now keeps the order coherence Cloud returns.
- Fixed `LobbyFilter.WithRegion` and `LobbyFilter.WithRegions` sending an invalid operator (such as `equals` instead of `=`) when used inside `WithAnd` or `WithOr`.
- Fixed `LobbySession` resource leak warnings (`Finalizer ~LobbySession executed without Dispose having been called`).
- Fixed some `OnSuccess` and `ContinueWith` callbacks of `LoginOperation`, `CoherenceTask` and `CloudOperation` running on a thread-pool thread instead of the main thread. Lobby calls made from them, such as rejoining a lobby after logging in, could fail with `An item with the same key has already been added`.
- A lobby response that was read successfully, but could not be applied to its `LobbySession`, is no longer reported as a deserialization error (`ResponseDeserializationException`).
- Fixed a pooled `CommandData` leak in baked code: a command whose arguments could not be written (for example, an argument of the wrong type) was left rented from the pool, and reported as a leak when the client disconnected. Re-bake to pick up the fix.
- The Replication Server no longer logs an error when a connection presents an auth token that is not a well-formed JWT, which happens when a connection request is corrupted in transit. The connection is still rejected with `InvalidChallenge`, and the rejection is logged at info level.
- Fixed the Replication Server terminating when a connection's reliable send window filled up, which happens when a client stops acknowledging packets. Reliable out-of-band messages are now held until the window reopens, a connection that cannot drain them is disconnected, and a failing connection or room tick is contained instead of taking the whole server down.
- Fixed every connection to a client-hosted Replication Server being denied with `InvalidChallenge` on consoles, iOS and Android. Newtonsoft.Json builds `JWT.Builder.JwtHeader` reflectively while decoding a token, so IL2CPP managed stripping (High by default on those platforms) removed the members it needs and no auth token or unlock token could be decoded. `Coherence.JWT` is now preserved from stripping.
- The Replication Server now verifies the auth token signature on all platforms again. On Unity-hosted servers it had been reduced to reading the token's subject without validating it, as a workaround for the stripping issue above.
- Fixed a component leak when an entity whose prefab is not yet resolved arrives more than once under the same unique id, which happens to a prefab sync group member that leaves and re-enters a client's view. The components of the earlier arrival were dropped without being returned to the pool.
- Fixed `ClientCore.ConnectionState` so it now reports `Opening` while the host name is being resolved, where it previously reported `Disconnected`.
- A client that closes a connection after sending its connect request, but before the Replication Server has accepted it, now tells the Replication Server. The Replication Server previously held such a connection until it timed out, where enough of them could fill the room.
- A login that completed after its `PlayerAccount` or `AuthClient` was disposed no longer throws a `NullReferenceException`, and no longer places the disposed account back into `PlayerAccount.All`. The login task now completes as canceled instead.
- Fixed `RoomData.KV` always being `null` (and `RoomData.RoomName` always being empty).
- Fixed `MissingReferenceException` failing the bake when a registered networked prefab has been destroyed mid-session (e.g. deleted and re-created without a domain reload). Such configs are now skipped.
- Fixed coherence Cloud messages that arrive while a client is briefly disconnected (such as lobby updates and invites) being silently dropped instead of delivered once the connection is back.
- Fixed `PlayerAccountId.GetHashCode()`, `CloudUniqueId.GetHashCode()`, and `GuestId.GetHashCode()` not agreeing with their `Equals`: a default-initialized instance (backing field `null`) is equal to `.None` (backing field `""`).
- Fixed the coherence Cloud connection being silently evicted when the same player account logs in from a second client: `AuthClient.OnError` now raises a `LoginError` whose `Type` is `ErrorType.ConcurrentConnection` (with its existing player-facing message) instead of a generic `ErrorType.ServerError`, and a warning is now logged.
- Fixed `AuthClient` login failures during the initial connection (WebSocket timeout, connection error) not being logged as warnings even though a `Warning` id was passed for them. Ordinary login failures (invalid credentials, invalid input, etc.) remain silent at this level, matching existing behavior.
- Fixed a `UnauthorizedAccessException` intermittently thrown while writing `Gathered.schema` on Windows, caused by the asset database's importer still holding the file open from a previous asynchronous import.
- Fixed `WebSocketManager` being able to end up permanently disabled after a `/connection/reconnect` push, silently degrading the client to plain HTTP requests for the rest of the session.
- Fixed baked command extension methods failing to compile when a command parameter is named `self`, `target`, or `sync`, colliding with the generator's own reserved identifiers (now `_self`, `coherenceMessageTarget`, and `__sync`).
- Fixed `OnSuccess` callbacks on cloud operations running on a background thread.
- Fixed the Dissonance Integration sample dropping all unreliable voice packets on a client whose system clock is set more than a few seconds ahead of the other players'. Voice packets are now timestamped with coherence's network time instead of `DateTime.UtcNow`, so the stale-audio check measures transit time rather than the gap between two machines' clocks.
- Fixed cloud request cooldowns, connection timeouts, WebSocket reconnect backoff and authority request timeouts never elapsing while the game is paused, and running slow while `Time.timeScale` is below 1, on Unity 6+.
- Refreshing or re-joining a lobby no longer creates another `LobbySession`, and is instead updated in place.

## 2.2.0

### Added
- CoherenceBridge inspector shows Cloud Service information, including logged in player account.
- Added descriptive `ConnectionException` surfaced via `CoherenceBridge.onConnectionError` when connecting to an unreachable Replication Server (e.g. not running, wrong port, or no route to host). Previously a raw `SocketException` escaped to the player loop. The error message now names the Replication Server endpoint.
- Added `IReplicationServer.IsReady` property that indicates when the Replication Server is ready to accept connections.
- Added `ICoherenceBridge.IsDestroyed` property, mirroring `ICoherenceSync.IsDestroyed`.
- On Windows, the Hub's copy RS command button now shows a context menu allowing to copy the command for Bash/CMD or PowerShell.
- Added `ConnectionSettings` to `CoherenceSceneLoaderConfig` and `CoherenceSceneData`, allowing custom connection settings (e.g. disconnect timeout) to be passed through `CoherenceSceneLoader` to `CoherenceScene`.
- CoherenceSync.SendCommand overloads that take a component instance.
- Baked command extension methods: commands can be invoked within the components that define them via `this.MethodName(MessageTarget, args...)` or `myScript.MethodName(MessageTarget, args...)`
- Entity references no longer limited to CoherenceSync, GameObject or Transform. Can use any Component subtype.
- A warning icon is now drawn in Play Mode in the Hierarchy window next to GameObjects containing a CoherenceBridge component when no baked code is found.
- Added help texts to Tag Query and Global Query components' editors.
- Added `CoherenceSyncConfigUtils.AddConfigToAddressablesGroup` public editor API to programmatically add a `CoherenceSyncConfig` to the Addressables group of its associated prefab.
- A warning is now logged to the Console if DotNetWebSocket is closed unexpectedly by the server (e.g. due to MessageTooBig).
- AutoSimulatorConnection can now automatically retry fetching worlds up to 10 times when an empty result is returned. This is because if a world is still starting, it won't be included in the results.
- Added a confirmation dialog before simulator builds when 'Strip Assets' is enabled, warning that assets may not be restored automatically if the build is interrupted or Unity crashes.
- Added a 'Restore Assets' button and warning in the Simulator build options UI when an orphaned asset backup is detected from a previously interrupted build, allowing assets to be recovered without manual file operations. Also added a button to open the backup location folder.
- Added CoherenceSync.TransferAuthorityAsync and CoherenceSync.AdoptAsync that can be awaited to easily defer execution until the request has completed or failed (similar to the existing CoherenceSync.RequestAuthorityAsync).
- Added `CoherenceBridge.LastEndpointData`, `CoherenceBridge.LastRoomData`, and `CoherenceBridge.LastWorldData` properties, exposing the connection data from the most recent connection attempt. Useful for accessing room/world info after disconnecting.
- Added `Script Debugging`, `Auto Connect Profiler` and `Deep Profiling Support` to Simulator Build Options in the coherence Hub window.
- Added `RoomData` overloads for `CloudRoomsService.RemoveRoom`, `RemoveRoomAsync`, `UnlistRoom`, `UnlistRoomAsync`, `ReplicationServerRoomsService.RemoveRoom`, `RemoveRoomAsync`, and the corresponding `IRoomsService` members. The `ulong uniqueID, string secret` overloads are now deprecated.
- Added option to customize web port (`--web-port`) to ReplicationServerConfig.

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Renamed `LobbiesService.JoinLobby` and `JoinLobbyAsync` parameter from `secret` to `password`. Callers using named arguments must update to `password:`. The underlying JSON request field has also been renamed from `"secret"` to `"password"` to match the backend API.
- **Breaking**: Part of the virtual `CoherenceInputSimulation` API made public for external control needs, e.g. replay system.
- Improved Perforce support for SDK-generated editor files.
- Renamed Coherence.Log/ to Coherence.Logging/ to avoid common `.gitignore` rules affecting sdk installations.
- Warnings about private `[Sync]` fields and `[Command]` methods are now re-emitted after every domain reload and shown as persistent helpboxes in the CoherenceSync inspector, making them harder to miss.
- Non-interpolated bindings no longer re-apply the last network value every frame. Values are applied once when a new sample arrives, reducing per-frame overhead. Interpolated bindings also skip work when interpolation has caught up. Note: unauthorized local writes to remote entity fields are no longer silently reverted each frame.
- A more descriptive error message is now logged if an attempt is made to send a command targeting a component that isn't attached to the networked entity at all.
- The 'Add Config to Addressables Group' prompt in CoherenceSync and CoherenceSyncConfig inspectors has been replaced with a compact button and tooltip.
- The tooltip for the coherence sync button in the project window now shows multiple projects when Cloud Project Mode is set to `Development, Release`. 
- Renamed SimulatorBuildPipeline.PrepareHeadlessBuild to PrepareBuild.
- Renamed SimulatorBuildPipeline.BuildHeadlessLinuxClientAsync to BuildAndUpload.
- `CloudRoomsService` async methods now wait for previous request cooldowns to expire before sending a new request, avoiding `TooManyRequests` exceptions automatically.
- CoherenceBridge now explains better how it interacts with CoherenceCloudLogin, and what it offers regarding coherence Cloud initialization.

### Fixed
- Fixed simulator upload hanging in the editor when the "Bake On Unity Player Build" automation is enabled. Baking now runs before the simulator build (after the simulator scripting symbols are set, and letting its recompilation finish first) instead of inside the build, so the freshly baked code is compiled into the uploaded build and the post-build recompilation no longer triggers a domain reload that drops the in-flight upload request. The composed order is now bake → upload schemas → upload build.
- Fixed `PrefabSyncGroup` child authority when duplicate unique root prefabs are resolved, ensuring child entities stay owned by the accepted root owner.
- Fixed coherence Cloud login not storing account information (hence creating new ones) every session on WebGL.
- Fixed synced entity references syncing as null when the referenced object was not on the same `GameObject` as the `CoherenceSync`.
- Fixed `CoherenceBridge.JoinWorld` overriding the UDP port supplied in the `WorldData` with `RuntimeSettings.LocalWorldUDPPort` when the host was a local address (e.g. `127.0.0.1`). The caller-provided port is now honored.
- Fixed `CoherenceBridge.JoinRoom` overriding the UDP port supplied in the `RoomData` with `RuntimeSettings.LocalRoomsUDPPort` for local rooms. The caller-provided port is now honored.
- Fixed `CloudRoomsService.FetchRoomsAsync` throwing `ArgumentNullException` when the Simulator Slug is null.
- Fixed schema parsing crashing (`Invalid double ... override value for key: precision`) on builds whose current culture uses a non-period decimal separator (notably WebGL, which adopts the browser locale). Numeric field overrides and archetype LOD distances are now parsed and written with the invariant culture.
- Fixed disconnect handling as a reaction to entity event which could cause issues like UUID of entities being swapped in a new session.
- Fixed binding settings (interpolation, sync mode, routing, prediction, LOD/sample rate) being reset to their defaults when a synced member's definition changed — for example adding or removing `[OnValueSynced]`, renaming a member, or changing a synced field's type. Settings the user configured are now carried over instead of being lost.
- Fixed enum bit count calculation for large signed and unsigned integer ranges.
- Fixed empty project name in the schema upload success log. The public project ID is now shown when the project has no name.
- Fixed editor log path resolution to use `Application.consoleLogPath` (now follows a custom `-logFile`) and to no longer throw when no console log path is available (e.g. with `-nolog`).
- Fixed degraded performance on Play Mode when the coherence Hub is opened.
- Fixed schema not uploading after bake when "Upload on Enter Play Mode" is enabled without "Upload on Baking Complete".
- Fixed server side entities not being disabled on bridges connected with `ConnectionType.Client` in simulator builds.
- Sync with coherence header for GameObjects not showing correct state while in Play Mode.
- Fixed assertions related to `AssetDatabase::IsAssetImportWorkerProcess()`.
- Fixed the Configure window incorrectly blocking editing when `CoherenceSync` is added to a prefab variant (as an expected component override relative to its parent prefab).
- Fixed conversion to network prefab (e.g., the 'Sync with coherence' toggle) failing when applied to a scene instance of a non-modifiable asset (e.g. an FBX model). A prefab variant of the source asset is now created, preserving the link to it.
- Fixed the Configure window showing the root prefab's CoherenceSync instead of the selected nested prefab's when opening the window while already inside a Prefab Stage.
- Fixed networked entity position reverting to its previous value when snapping beyond the teleport distance on a `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2D` with Unity interpolation enabled.
- Fixed multiple redundant warnings appearing in the Console when a login attempt fails (e.g. schema not uploaded). A single descriptive warning is now logged instead of three or more.
- Fixed transient `ReplicationManagerCommandNotAllowed` errors during authority-request races (for example with multiple `AutoAuthRequester`s), by treating self-requests as idempotent instead of invalid.
- Fixed input authority transferred to a client not being applied when the entity's instantiation was deferred (for example, while waiting for its parent to be created).
- Fixed server-initiated disconnect reason being lost and reported as `SocketClosedByPeer`.
- Fixed `ObjectDisposedException` in `UnityConsoleTarget` that could occur during domain reload when the Visual Studio debugger is attached.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` in `DescriptorProvider` when a CoherenceSync component inherits from a base class with unsupported property types.
- Fixed `CoherenceTagQuery` logging unnecessary warnings when the tag is empty, to support dynamically assigning tags at runtime.
- Fixed UDP port reuse issue where multiple sockets in the same process could be assigned the same ephemeral port, causing the replication server to see combined traffic and trigger recv-frequency throttling.
- Fixed `CoherenceScene.IsConnected` throwing `MissingReferenceException` when accessed on a destroyed `CoherenceScene` whose loaded scene was unloaded due to a connection failure.
- Fixed empty debug assertion message when `CoherenceBridge` initializes without baked network code.
- Fixed local simulator ignoring custom port from `--coherence-port` when connecting to a local world.
- Fixed baking generating code for editor-only MeshRenderer properties (`receiveGI`, `scaleInLightmap`, `stitchLightmapSeams`) that caused compile errors in player and simulator builds.
- Fixed confusing destination path shown in the success log when bundling the replication server with a build.
- Fixed duplicate troubleshooting messages in sample connection script when failing to connect to the Replication Server.
- Fixed loading CoherenceSync prefabs in Resources folders with complex paths.
- Hierarchy icons will hide instead of overflow.
- Avoid some asset modifications when using MPPM and ParrelSync.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when calling `CoherenceBridge` methods (`Disconnect`, `Reconnect`, `KickConnection`, etc.) on a bridge that was destroyed because a main bridge already exists. Calls are now redirected to the main bridge with a warning.
- Fixed `CoherenceBridge.NetworkTime` returning null when accessed on a bridge that was destroyed because a main bridge already exists. Now returns the main bridge's `NetworkTime` instead.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` in `CoherenceSync` when accessing `NetworkTime` on a bridge that was destroyed because a main bridge already exists.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` in `CoherenceSync.HandleConnected` when the referenced `CoherenceBridge` has been destroyed and replaced by a main bridge.
- Fixed 'Apply To Base Prefab' in Optimize window context menu not applying changes to base prefab when target was being edited in Prefab Mode.
- Fixed 'Revert Prefab Overrides' in Optimize window context menu not reverting overrides made to base prefab when target was being edited in Prefab Mode.
- Fixed AutoSimulatorConnection logging in as a guest instead of a simulator.
- Fixed `ArgumentNullException` when clicking "Use Simulator" in the Hub Simulators tab without a project selected. The toggle is now disabled with a tooltip when no project is configured.
- Implemented chunking in DotNetWebSocket.SendAsync to avoid exceeding server's max frame length of 32 KB if a user tries to send too much data in one go (e.g. via `CloudStorage.SaveObjectAsync`).
- Fixed icon loading errors on install.
- Fixed tag sync between clients. Added ability to clear the tag and a new "Update" button to push changes to the clients.
- Fixed "Project not set" error when building a simulator despite a project being configured.
- Fixed CoherenceSync prefabs not prompting an update when a `[Command]` or `[Sync]` attribute is removed from a member that still exists on the component.
- Fixed a bug where removing [Command] would not remove the binding.
- If the login token expires users are now automatically logged out and instructed to log in again via a Console message.
- Prevented schema uploading from being triggered while scripts are being compiled or when baking is in progress, since those could interrupt the upload process.
- Improved error messaging when a Cloud replication server crashes (`ERR_RS_BAD_REQUEST`), now surfacing a descriptive message with the server-provided id instead of a generic HTTP 400 error.
- Improved error message shown when uploading a simulator fails due to the organization having no payment method configured in the Online Dashboard.
- Fixed `ArgumentNullException` during `CoherenceSync` initialization when there is no baked schema and a null `client` is passed to `CoherenceSyncUpdater`.
- Added support for commands targeting methods defined in generic base classes.
- Fixed changing the Simulator Slug in the coherence Hub not marking the `RuntimeSettings` asset dirty, so the change was silently lost when saving the project.
- Simulator Slug UI in coherence Hub now has undo support.
- Simulator Slug UI in coherence Hub now remembers previously provided simulator slug when re-enabling 'Use Simulator'.
- Fixed issue where commands could be executed on a prefab asset. Commands can only be executed on a scene instance of a prefab.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when double-clicking the 'Run Local Simulator' button in the Hub Simulators tab.
- Fixed rare crashing issue when using UDP Transport.
- Fixed interpolation type picker becoming disabled after setting interpolation to None in Play Mode, preventing further changes.
- Fixed simulator build and upload being blocked when using multiple projects and only a subset of them have a simulator slug configured. Projects without a slug are now skipped with a warning instead of blocking the entire build.
- Fixed `SchemaNotFound` login failures when using Development/Release cloud project mode with "Bake on Enter Play Mode" and "Upload Schema on Baking Complete": the Release-only upload option has been removed (the editor always connects via the Development project, so uploading only to Release would cause login failures), and play mode entry is now deferred until the upload finishes so the runtime never connects before the schema reaches the cloud.
- SimulatorBuildPipeline and Schema uploading improvements in batch mode to avoid deadlocking.
- Don't show 'channel closed' errors on Web builds on intentional disconnects.
- `GameServersService` now catches throttle exceptions (`ErrorCode.TooManyRequests`) from the cloud API and logs a warning instead of letting them propagate silently. Void methods (`SuspendAsync`, `ResumeAsync`, `DeleteAsync`) swallow the exception after logging; value-returning methods (`DeployAsync`, `ListAsync`, `MatchAsync`, `GetAsync`) rethrow so callers can handle or retry.
- Fixed edge case issue where AuthClient might not always properly handle PlayerAccount disposal.
- Fixed orphaned entity auto adoption caused by a timing issue.
- Fixed coherence Hub window showing an 'Uploading schemas failed' message even when the upload actually succeeded when `Cloud Project Mode` is set to `Development, Release`.
- Improved `PrefabSyncGroup`'s reliability when handling multiple nested networked prefabs.
- Fixed CoherenceSync's Preserve Children in Unity version 6.4 and later.
- Improved `PrefabSyncGroup` inspector.
- IDisposable handling fixes.
- Fixed a crash in the Editor caused by file-descriptor exhaustion when many coherence log messages were written in quick succession. `FileLog` now holds a single persistent `FileStream` open for the session instead of reopening the file on every log call.
- Fixed a rare NullReferenceException happening on an update of child entities of PrefabSyncGroups, while the parent entity is moving out of query.
- Fixed `FileLog` writes not being immediately visible to concurrent readers on macOS (in particular in Unity batch mode); the persistent `FileStream` is now opened with `bufferSize: 1` so each write bypasses the .NET write buffer and lands in the OS page cache directly.
- Fix for relative log file paths resolving incorrectly in some scenarios
- Fixed `FileLog` incorrectly stopping all file logging when deleting the previous session's log file is denied. File logging now continues to the current session's log file regardless.
- Fixed the cached project name in `RuntimeSettings` and `ProjectSettings` not being updated after the project was renamed in the Online Dashboard.
- Fixed `NetworkPool.WarmUpInstantiator` throwing a NullReferenceException if a CoherenceBridge was being destroyed during asset loading.
- Fixed `FileLog`'s persistent `FileStream` throwing an exception on writes after the first domain reload of an editor session (e.g. after entering/exiting Play Mode once). The stream is now explicitly closed before assembly reload instead of being left for the GC to finalize.
- Fixed `NullReferenceException` in the Rooms UI sample (`RoomsDialogUI`) when the `lanOnlineToggle` reference is missing, for example in a customized copy of the sample with the LAN/Online toggle removed. The dialog now defaults to Cloud mode instead of crashing.
- Hardened `FileLog` against the static constructor not re-running its `FileStream` setup before the next log call following a domain reload; the stream is now also reopened lazily on demand if it isn't already open.
- Fixed `ReplicationServerRoomsService.FetchRoomsAsync`/`FetchRooms` throwing `ResponseDeserializationException` when filtering rooms by tags and a room in the response has no tags (`null`). Such rooms are now correctly treated as not matching any tag filter instead of throwing.

## 2.1.3

- Fixed `DllNotFoundException` crash on Nintendo Switch when joining a room, caused by `EndpointData` calling unsupported `NetworkInterface` API at runtime.

## 2.1.0

### Added
- Added `CoherenceSync.SynchronizeParent` property that allows disabling parent hierarchy synchronization for optimization purposes when the parent is not expected to change.
- Added RequestAuthorityAsync and RequestAuthority with onRequestFinished callback to simplify the code needed to request authority over an entity, wait for the request to complete, and determine whether the request succeeded or not.
- Support for manual sync mode on bindings. Bindings can now be configured with `SyncMode.Manual` to only synchronize when explicitly triggered via the `MarkForSyncing()` method.
- Added `Scene` index to the ClientConnection, this can be accessed for your own ClientConnection but also for others too.
- CoherenceSync and CoherenceSyncConfig editors now display a warning box and a fix button, if the CoherenceSync uses AddressablesProvider, but the CoherenceSyncConfig does not belong to any addressables group, given that this could result in duplicated CoherenceSyncConfig instances being loaded.
- Error messages are displayed in the console window if `[Sync]` or `[Command]` are attached to fields, properties or methods that are private.
- When mouseovering a component in the Optimization window, the name of the GameObject to which the component is attached to is now shown as a tooltip. Since the Optimization window can list bindings from child GameObjects as well as the prefab root, this can help differentiate between multiple components of the same type that are attached to different GameObjects.
- Added support for WebSocket disconnecting and reconnecting when requested by the backend.
- CloudLogin: show Player ID.

### Changed
- The `CoherenceSync.coherenceTag` field has been made private. Use the `CoherenceSync.CoherenceTag` property instead. The tag field is no longer editable from the Inspector at runtime; use the property setter in code to change the tag at runtime.
- Improve UI responsiveness during various asynchronous operations in the Editor.
- Changes made in Project Settings are now saved to disk immediately.
- Hub window performance optimized.
- Client connections are now visible to all clients regardless of their scene.
- The settings of a new Interpolation Settings to be equal to the Default Interpolation settings.
- Ports and send/recv frequency properties moved from ProjectSettings into RuntimeSettings.
- Deprecated EndpointData.Validate()

### Fixed
- Fixed `CommandsHandler` throwing an exception when trying to log a warning about a destroyed `CoherenceSync`.
- Fixed Welcome Window and CoherenceHub being opened in MPPM virtual player instances, causing unsupported window warnings.
- Fixed warnings about moved asset references when importing Matchmaking UI sample from Package Manager.
- Fixed potential dead-locking issues in batch mode due to usage of Task.Wait.
- CoherenceBridgeStore.DeregisterBridge can now also be used to deregister the main bridge.
- Fixed issue where Optimization window's binding menu would list items that should have only been shown for prefab variants for non-prefab variants.
- Any exceptions occurring in synced property setters or methods executed by commands are now caught and won't interfere with networking of other bindings.
- Exceptions thrown by INetworkObjectInstantiator.Instantiatiate are now caught and converted into descriptive warnings.
- When multiple instances of the same application are running simultaneous on the same machine, each instance will now log in to coherence Cloud using a difference Guest Id when logging in as a guest, even in the case of non-development builds.
- Project window icon now warns about no project being selected if RuntimeSettings contains a selected project, but that project is not actually found in the project list of the selected organization.
- Unity Logs settings in Project Settings are now disabled for ParrelSync clones when CloneMode.AllowEdits is not set true.
- Fix for local simulator address and parameters being filled with remote details
- Fixed issue where WorldService.FetchWorlds could sometimes fail with an InvalidOperationException.
- Fix for exception when interpolation property is null
- Warnings appearing in the console window at startup when coherence/editor.log is missing
- Better handling for null parameter value in `CloudRooms.GetRoomServiceForRegion()`
- Fixed NullReferenceException if the coherence Hub window is maximized with the Networked Prefabs tab in focus.
- CoherenceSceneLoader no longer throws an exception when trying to load while exiting Play Mode.
- Indefinitely growing buffer when interpolation settings are changed during runtime
- Serialization of emojis in strings
- Fix for exception being thrown when requesting data from portal
- Zip executable not found on macOS + Unity 6.3+
- Interpolation settings disabled on child GameObjects
- CoherenceSync: transfer authority APIs fail gracefully when there's no CoherenceBridge instance available
- Able to configure Prefab Variants that attach a CoherenceSync component.
- Configure window opens Prefab Variants in Isolation instead of the Variant Parent.
- In Hub's Cloud tab, the link to the schemas dashboard page redirects properly when using a custom project identifier
- In Hub's Cloud tab, the Online Dashboard link opens the specific project, if any selected.
- "Fix Prefab Instance" button no longer shows when adding component overrides on prefab instances.
- Fixed Matchmaking Sample UI getting stuck after lobby session starts.
- Can use custom ports for starting and connecting to the Replication Server.
- CoherenceBridge connection status icon in the hierarchy now updates correctly without requiring a click.

## 2.0.0

### Added
- PingClient - new functionality for measuring latency to coherence servers. Supports both UDP and TCP protocols with configurable timeout and cancellation token support.
- CoherenceNode and CoherenceSync editors now detect if CoherenceSync contains invalid configuration for the CoherenceNode, and display warning messages as well buttons to fix the issue.
- Support for ClientID as a command and component primitive.
- coherence logging to file now supports game builds.
- Improved error messages for when a simulator slug has been set but simulator support has not been enabled for rooms in the Online Dashboard.
- Support for multiple tags in coherence sync tags and tag queries using | separator.
- CoherenceSync inspector now disables Request Authority buttons when Authority Transfer is set to "Not transferable", providing clear visual feedback to users.
- Error icons on Scene Hierarchy window for CoherenceBridge, CoherenceQuery and CoherenceCloudLogin (shown when errors found while in Play Mode). 
- Optimization window now visualizes prefab values overrides of optimizations done on prefab variants.
- Added ability to apply prefab value overrides to base prefab in the Optimization window.
- Added ability to revert prefab value override changes done on top of a base prefab in the Optimization window.
- You will now see warnings if you have synced more than the maximum number of variables per component (32) in the CoherenceSync Editor, the Configuration window and during baking.
- Support for syncing bindings and commands containing big data over fragmented channels.
- Extended Project Settings with ability to customize whether messages logged to the Console window by coherence should include a watermark, timestamp or source type.
- An error box is shown in CoherenceSync Editor if the GameObject is not a prefab nor a prefab instance.
- Worlds UI sample will now automatically try to reconnect to the last connected world if the backend shuts it down, in case the backend restarts the world.
- Added ICoherenceSync.SetActive(bool). This works the same as GameObject.SetActive(bool), except that it handles unparenting child networked objects before setting the GameObject inactive if 'Preserve Children' is enabled, which can help avoid encountering the error 'Cannot set the parent of the GameObject 'X' while activating or deactivating the parent GameObject 'Y'.
- Added support for sending commands to an interface as well as the concrete class.
- Added optional IRelay.Flush() callback method for custom relay implementations.
- Added CloudService.Regions access point for region-related functionality.
- Refresh button in Networked Prefabs window to update the view.

### Changed
- Updated Simulator Slug configuration GUI in the Hub to better clarify that it applies to the project as a whole and not just  simulator builds. Also added a link to documentation.
- Removed the size limit of commands and inputs.
- Removed the size limit of strings and byte arrays in both commands and bindings.
- Made it possible to create lobbies that are not associated with any rooms. This makes it possible to create lobbies even if you have a Simulator Slug configured in coherence Hub, but have not enabled simulators for rooms in the Online Dashboard.
- Migrated CloudStorage access point to CloudStorage from CloudService.GameServices.
- Marked GameServices.MatchmakerService as obsolete. CloudService.Lobbies should be used instead.
- CoherenceSync.CoherenceBridge will now continue returning a non-null value even after the networked entity has been destroyed. This means that other components can safely access the bridge via this property during their OnDisable and OnDestroy events and more easily do things like unsubscribe event handlers from the CoherenceBridge's events.
- Made LobbiesService.GetLobbySessions obsolete, because it could not reliably return data for the lobbies that the player
  belongs if they log out out then log back in while inside a lobby. Added LobbiesService.GetLobbySessionsAsync and
  LobbiesService.GetLobbySessionIds which work reliably even in this situation.

## 0.8.0
### Added
- New command target "Other": send a command to all instances, excluding yourself.
- CoherenceSync.ResetInterpolation() to prevent interpolation to kick in in some cases, such as teleporting entities.
- BakeUtil exposes bake functionality.
- Double precision NetworkTime utility.
- FixedUpdateInput in the CoherenceMonoBridge that solves the 'FixedUpdate' input sampling (loss) issue.
- Debug ability to pause sending packets from Coherence.Connection to provide 'dropped' packet integration tests.
- Disconnection reason in the 'OnDisconnect' event.
- Support for multi-room simulators.
- CoherenceSceneLoader and CoherenceScene to handle multi-scene setups.
- SimulatorEventHandler component to expose events depending on if your build should behave as a client or as a simulator.
- ConnectionEventHandler component to expose connection related events.
- Support for all protocol primitives in reflected mode (long, quaternions, vector types) in both commands and components.
- Per-scene context for logging.
- Unsigned int / long types to protocol primitives.
- Interpolation of unsigned int / longs.

### Changed
- CoherenceClientConnection no longer requires subclassing, any GameObject with the CoherenceSync attached can be used.
- Separate prefabs for client and simulator connection objects in the CoherenceMonoBridge.
- Fine grained control over connection object prefab through the CoherenceMonoBridge.ClientConnections.ProvidePrefab event.
- Schema definitions for String64 and Byte4096 changed to String and Bytes.
- Support 63 byte strings in schema fields, up from 61
- Support 511 byte byte arrays in schema fields, down from 4096, but could never send that much anyway, so memory is saved.
- Removed 'connectionID' from the 'OnDisconnect' event.
- A CoherenceMonoBridge should be included in the scene for coherence find it — they won't be created on the fly anymore.
- Optimized sending command parameters in reflected mode.  Only as much data as needed is sent and the limitations on numbers of parameters is removed except for entity references which is still capped at 4.  The rest of the parameters only have to fit in 511 bytes, in total, to be sent.
- Authentication is now enforced when connecting to the Replication Server. This is handled automatically when using the provided UI utility or when developing locally. When connecting manually, the 'EndpointData.authToken' must be set before calling the 'IClient.Connect'. Use 'Auth.SessionToken' to retrieve token provided by Play services.
- PlayClient requests are now throttled.
- CoherenceSync authority events no longer fire on instantiation and upon connecting to server.

### Fixed
- Input owner initialization for the CoherenceInput with 'ClientSide' simulation.
- Interpolation elasticity using properly scaled network time.
- Exception in CoherenceSync.Awake() when using CoherenceInput.
- CoherenceInput.Delay is now reset back to the base value upon time sync.

- String serialization for non-ASCII characters.
- No longer sending delete entity updates after a dropped create.
- Sending only when there's space in the ack window.
- Command name string length off-by-one error.
- CoherenceInput network time reset loop with 'Disconnect on time reset' enabled.
- CoherenceInputSimulation can be run with just one client.
- CoferenceInput pause logic.
- Now detecting when a message is too large to serialize and logging error instead of sending broken packet to RS.
- Fix allowing Simulators to regain authority over transferred CoherenceInput objects with a refactor of how auto authority is processed.
- Fix allowing commands with no parameters to work again.
- Interpolation of integer types at large values.
- Issue when selecting actively updating CoherenceSync object which caused editor warnings and errors.
- Server-side inputs not working due to the forever-withheld authority transfer.
- CoherenceSync "Optimize" window layout issues.
- CoherenceSync "Optimize" window numeric limits handling.
- Clamping int and uint values to the range specified in the "Optimize" window.
- Auto-adopt is now more reliable, there are not disputes over authority.
